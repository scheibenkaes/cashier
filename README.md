# Cashier


Trying to approximate how long a line at the supermarket will take using Fibonacci numbers.

## Theory

The older a person is, the longer it takes him or her to proceed in a line.
Same goes for the cashier.
The app ranks lines based on that crude theory:

|-----------|---------------------------|
| Age range | Number equivalent         |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Children  | 0 (Are currently ignored) |
| Teens     | 1                         |
| Twens     | 2                         |
| Thirties  | 3                         |
| Fourties  | 5                         |
| Fifties   | 8                         |
| 50+       | 13                        |
|-----------|---------------------------|


So the smaller the number of a line the better.
